F1GP3 Car Editor   (Modding Tool for Microprose Formula 1 PC Game from early 2000's)

Over 20 years ago I worked on tools to help the GP2 modding community, having thought I had lost all the source I recently rediscovered it.

I'm uploading for anyone still using this tools to enjoy and build (currently builds with Visual Studio 2017 x86 and x64)

Note: this source is from a slightly earlier version of the car editor (not the version 3.4 that is available as a binary from various websites)

It maybe the sources between those versions is lost forever, but for now lets get the source in the community.
